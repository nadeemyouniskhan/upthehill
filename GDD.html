                Game Concept
            </h3>
            <p><pre>
The object of Up The Hill Racing is to drive as far through progressively difficult racing stages as possible while 
collecting coins, taking advantage of the nonrealistic physics and using only two simple controls: the Gas 
and Brake pedals. While in midair, pressing these pedals will instead cause the vehicle to rotate, allowing the player 
to control the angle with which they land. Fuel is replenished by picking up gas canisters or batteries along the way. 
The player can perform stunts such as driving the vehicle into the air for a prolonged time or flipping it over to earn 
more coins, which after the race may be spent on upgrades or to unlock new stages and vehicles (including monster trucks, 
dirt bikes, tanks).Conditions ending the game are depleting the vehicle's fuel or hitting the driving 
avatar's head. </pre>  </p>
