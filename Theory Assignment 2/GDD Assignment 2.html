                        The object of Up The Hill Racing is to drive as far through progressively difficult racing
                        stages as possible while collecting coins,
                        taking advantage of the nonrealistic physics and using only two simple controls: the Gas and
                        Brake pedals. While in midair,
                        pressing these pedals will instead cause the vehicle to rotate, allowing the player to control
                        the angle with which they land.
                        Fuel is replenished by picking up gas canisters or batteries along the way. The player can
                        perform stunts such as driving the vehicle into the air for a prolonged time or flipping it over
                        to earn more coins,
                        which after the race may be spent on upgrades or to unlock new stages and vehicles (including
                        monster trucks,
                        dirt bikes, tanks).Conditions ending the game are depleting the vehicle's fuel or hitting the
                        driving avatar's head.

                        Fuel management plays a key part in the gameplay. As you drive, your fuel gauge will slowly deplete
 (keep in mind that the vehicles all have different sized fuel tanks). When you run out of fuel, you will roll to 
a stop and it's game over. You can extend your run by collecting the red fuel canisters (Fuel canister.png) to refill
 your fuel along the way. If there is a fuel canister nearby, you will see a countdown appear on the right-hand side
 of the screen showing how close you are to the fuel canister.
