                        The object of Up The Hill Racing is to drive as far through progressively difficult racing
                        stages as possible while collecting coins,
                        taking advantage of the nonrealistic physics and using only two simple controls: the Gas and
                        Brake pedals. While in midair,
                        pressing these pedals will instead cause the vehicle to rotate, allowing the player to control
                        the angle with which they land.
                        Fuel is replenished by picking up gas canisters or batteries along the way. The player can
                        perform stunts such as driving the vehicle into the air for a prolonged time or flipping it over
                        to earn more coins,
                        which after the race may be spent on upgrades or to unlock new stages and vehicles (including
                        monster trucks,
                        dirt bikes, tanks).Conditions ending the game are depleting the vehicle's fuel or hitting the
                        driving avatar's head.

                        Fuel management plays a key part in the gameplay. As you drive, your fuel gauge will slowly deplete
 (keep in mind that the vehicles all have different sized fuel tanks). When you run out of fuel, you will roll to 
a stop and it's game over. You can extend your run by collecting the red fuel canisters (Fuel canister.png) to refill
 your fuel along the way.

                        Every vehicle has a Boost Gauge in the bottom center which indicates the current boost pressure. 
The dial will raise from zero to full as long as you hold down the accelerator uninterrupted. Releasing the accelerator
 or braking will lose all boost, even in the air.

Once the boost gauge is full, the needle will eventually begin to shake if you have the Tuning Part "Overcharged Turbo" equipped. 
This means that the boost pressure is close to release. Shortly after this, if you do not interrupt your acceleration, the boost
 pressure will release and your Overcharged Turbo will engage, giving you a boost of speed.

After releasing the boost pressure via your Overcharged Turbo, you will need to release the accelerator or brake in order
 to begin charging your turbo boost again. This works unlimited times, but it takes every vehicle a different amount of time 
to charge an overcharged turbo because the engine is revving up at a different rate.

When you charge up the boost with the Super Diesel or the Racing Truck and your needle stops charging the Overcharged Turbo,
 you can quickly click the brake pedal in very small intervals and your Overcharged Turbo will resume charging.

                        Landing Boost can be performed with the "Landing Boost" tuning part equipped by ensuring the vehicle lands from an 
at least 2 Airtime long jump with all its wheels touching the ground simultaneously. Successfully performing this move will be signified by 
a sudden "dash" forward of speed by your vehicle, as well as a discharge of sparks from the wheels and a distinctive sound. If you combine
 it with "Jump Shocks" and activate them at the right moment, it will gives you a boost up and you can speed up your momentum for a longer 
time by perfectly performed jumps

                video game is far
                from a trivial task, and while maintaining internal documentation may seem like a tedious task, it can
